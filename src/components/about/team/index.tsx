                            Saying Justin Lu is only the project manager would be an understatement. He has worked at all ends of development: designed the overall website, recruited/selected other team members, created front-end pages, and as a whole has championed Project Metropolis since its inception in May. When Justin's not dealing with Vice-President responsibilities or schoolwork, he fanboys Johnny Harris (like a true Canadian), grinds the heck out of Genshin Impact, and tries to "live without regret," to varying degrees of success. He's also obsessed with macOS keyboard shortcuts - some of his favourites are CMD + OPT + SHIFT + V and KLDSJFSDF.

She is as relatable as a frontend developer can get, with her acknowledgement of procrastination and zeal for grinding Monkeytype. She is also as cool as one gets, being a spirited chess player and hockey fan. No true Canadian, nor Lyon for that matter, will ever feel lonely at a hockey game with Hazel who supports the Leafs (and especially enjoys watching them throw leads!) with all her heart.

He is somehow so sharp witted and sui generis that his talents would be wasted if he were not here, tasked with creating the announcement and blog pages as well as fixing much of the errors found during QA (quality assurance) testing. Eric is easygoing, knowledgeable, and a great source of inside jokes (case in point: 夜核). He spends his spare time writing music arrangements, reading manga and light novels, regularly updating his Discord statuses and names in Japanese, and immersing himself in new languages.

                            A man of classic and contemporary taste, Peter's all-time favourite music consists of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen and "Night Burn" by Ben Segev. His wide range of interests, from "Lord of the Rings" and roller skating to coding and all boils down to dreams of being a software developer. He's certainly getting his training in - you can thank Peter for the timetable banner and authentication page updates. Being a Toronto Argonauts fan, one may find him throwing and kicking footballs during wellness breaks. In the meanwhile, he'll be relishing his dumplings and praying in advance to pass Grade 12 Chemistry next year.

His dev experience (and tech rep responsibilities) compelled him to join Project Metropolis, where he's managed to share his LEGO expertise and his love-hate relationship with programming. For Patrick, the greatest inventions of all time include hockey, science fiction dystopias, and thin-crust pizza (meat required).

He fittingly describes himself as outgoing - he likes being around other people and is passionate about what he pursues, so much so that on his bucket list is travelling the world. Currently, Aaron has taken on the excellent development opportunity that encompasses building Project Metropolis' mobile app. He loves programming (and school!) so much that his favourite subjects are ICS and TEJ, and he would even take ICS2 again, partial credits to Mr. Wong. A man who would wish for "more time" if he could, Aaron un(ironically) lives by the words "seek discomfort" and "work smart, not hard." You can find him playing Tetris, enjoying noodles and dumplings, listening to radio and Chinese pop, all while dreaming of being CEO of a company he founded and having a dog.

Zoe intends to continue living her life listening (to Chelc), doing her best, and designing graphics.

                            Derek Ma has such a bland personality he knows it. While others describe him as intimidating, Derek uses his suspiciously unsourced British-ism to describe himself as "conscientious"  and embrace his appreciation for good manners. Jokes aside, Derek's a genuinely good person. Like anyone with decent taste, his favourite food is lasagna. Like any true WLMAC patriot, his favourite part about the school is the geese. And like any stereotypical tryhard, Derek would retake ICS if he could and he dreams of being an investment banker. On his bucket list, constructed from his stonks, cinematography, and computer hardware interests is building a computer, whaling on at least one character in Genshin Impact, and making it to retirement. Old age seems to be a genuine fear since Derek would wish, if he could, to advance healthcare to the point of curing ageing. However, we'll never know too much about the man who claims a cool fact about himself is that he likes starting fires. In a fireplace.

                            Connie Zhang is a fine example of someone who knows where and if her tastes lie, and based on that, makes the decisions that shape her authenticity. According to she who describes herself as "incredibly passive," Connie applied to Project Metropolis half-expecting to get rejected. However, her passion, including her fondness of horror, is exactly what our team values. Her spicy fancies, from dying her hair pastel pink to eating instant noodles so hot she can't taste anything else, make Connie super cool. If that isn't enough to get you to stop and stare, Connie's art is so good the artist herself states that she'd rather the fashion of the clothes she likes drawing over the world's mode manias.

As for why she’s here on Project Metropolis, the Laufey lover intends to give WLMAC some fun content to enjoy and, definitely not more importantly, help the team get sleep.

                            With her soulful heart, Celine is sure to make a lasting impact wherever she sets foot; quite literally, as she is a cardinal member of the Mac Dance Team. Her favourite movies are empowering rom-com hits from the 90s/200s, including Mean Girls and Legally Blonde, and her music taste extends from Ariana Grande to Blackpink. For Celine, Project Metropolis means an opportunity, not only to work with fellow (math) savants but to ensure WLMAC's ears are open to good music. For now, she would highly recommend listening to Eighteen by Key. To reinforce her wish for everyone to look back on life with no regrets, here are the song lyrics Celine lives by, "My mama said I'm living today for tomorrow, my daddy said it won't be easy but that's life, you only live once."

                            Wholesome and compassionate, Hassan is a cinnamon bun that makes sweetness all but natural and life hopeful. He joined Project Metropolis because he wanted to contribute to a place that genuinely informs and connects students. To thank him for his heroism, or just to hear about his endeavours, you can find Hassan chilling with music - likely soft indie, - dystopian lits, thrillers, or, if you're lucky enough to find him tired, a cheesy romance. In the future, though, you'll be more likely to find the man a journalist or professor, living his dream.

                            Caleb is special in many ways, most good, some cool, and others still, merely special. There's the honest confession that he measures 154cm in height. Then there's the "orz"-inducing declaration that he spends his spare time programming, creating minigames like Mahjong and Tetris, and dedicating/sacrificing some more time/sleep to perfecting them. The most wonderful part about Caleb, though, asides from his love of glitch-hop/jpop, badminton, and curling, is that he is one of those rare golden souls that genuinely lives by words like, "treat others the way you want to be treated" and " you fail, you forget." Welp, everyone will be failing to forget Caleb.

                            A video game and keyboard hobbyist, the things that make James James are also what make him a slick game developer for Mac Lyons' Den. His favourite game is "Control" and he immerses himself wholeheartedly in the realm of alternative/modern rock like Twenty One Pilots, Half-Alive, and Weathers. He interestingly and genuinely considers ICS his favourite subject. Most fascinating, however, James proclaims a passionate food predilection for all vegetables, raw or cooked.
