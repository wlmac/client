        1: 'Regarded as a central member of the team and known as a full stack developer, Paul is responsible for bringing the site and app to life through his work in API development and in the back-end framework Django. Paul\'s ingenuity and intelligence is matched with patience and a willingness to help others with whatever they need. He is not only a valuable member of Project Metropolis, but also a reliable friend to go to when you have absolutely no clue about how a database works. Aside from the outstanding work he does, Paul can be found on Discord using :monkey: to describe a variety of complex emotions.',
        3: 'Ivy\'s back-end development duties entail some incredibly immersive work such as dealing with the site\'s REST API, database models, and calendar. A loyal and supportive friend through and through, Ivy joined the initiative upon hearing the call. They also save time for playing the flute and 3-D printing.',
        4: 'Saying Justin Lu is only the project manager would be an understatement. He has worked at all ends of development: designed the overall website, recruited/selected other team members, created front-end pages, and as a whole has championed Project Metropolis since its inception in May. When Justin\'s not dealing with Vice-President responsibilities or schoolwork, he fanboys Johnny Harris (like a true Canadian), grinds the heck out of Genshin Impact, and tries to \"live without regret,\" to varying degrees of success. He\'s also obsessed with macOS keyboard shortcuts - some of his favourites are CMD + OPT + SHIFT + V and KLDSJFSDF.',
        5: 'Chelsea is the shortest person in our staff. All illustrations on the website, from the map to the login graphics, are her original work, truly a testament to how height doesn\'t mean everything. All jokes aside, Chelsea also runs her own music corner, creates her own calligraphy, and wastes her life away watching cheesy K-dramas.',
        6: 'Eric Shim may be the closest person within our staff to a weeb. He is somehow so sharp witted and sui generis that his talents would be wasted if he were not here, tasked with creating the announcement and blog pages as well as fixing much of the errors found during QA (quality assurance) testing. Eric is easygoing, knowledgeable, and a great source of inside jokes (case in point: 夜核). He spends his spare time writing music arrangements, reading manga and light novels, regularly updating his Discord statuses and names in Japanese, and immersing himself in new languages.',
        8: 'Although Bernie has a tendency to portray himself as a typical nerd, one look at his character would suffice to prove he is anything but inauthentic. With a genuine love for the piano and sandbox games, he dreams of being a video game composer. However, just like the rest of us, Bernie admits WLMAC deserves what Project Metropolis will foster… in the meantime, he recommends broadening your horizons by trying some 小笼包.',
        9: 'Upbeat, explicit, and stalwart, Patrick is as cool as project leads come. A defender for the Mackenzie community, he saw in Project Metropolis his vision of a true student platform. Since his days as a founding member, Patrick has exercised his (love-hate) programming vocation to develop our app and holiday doodle games. As Lead, he intends to give the website and app a makeover and a billion more doodle games life. Someday, this Kenshi Yonezu stan will be a founder of a tech company or a bigtime game developer. Remember then that Patrick loves thin crust pizza (meat required), LEGO, and hockey.',
        13: 'Mind constantly brimming with a myriad of ideas along with the drive to make them happen, Nicole yearns to both reach for heaven (see the northern lights) and stay grounded (go camping in Algonquin Park), all while keeping up to date with her MasterChef videos. She\'s also passionate about digital art and multiplayer video games like Overcooked, Stardew Valley, and (like half our staff) Valorant.',
        14: 'Unafraid of challenges, 42km ahead, 8849m up, or right inside of oneself, Misheel explores the world with a sixth sense - writing - and offers a glimpse into her fierce, kind-hearted self. Too modest to admit to her many talents, you may not know about Misheel\'s ability to disregard recipes yet somehow make them more delicious, speed-watch anime on 1.5x, and defend Godfather (the novel) like there\'s no tomorrow. The future professor\'s passion for Project Metropolis rings clear through her contributions to \"A Day in the Life of\", \"Make or Break\" and \"Year by Year\" and her unwavering support for the team.',
        16: 'Passionate, avid, and bearing a sharp eye for masterful world-building and science, Aava designed the school map and its remarkable features. In addition, she is an adamant advocate of sci-fi fantasy author Brandon Sanderson and cherishes WLMAC\'s science and math teachers for their efforts and talents. Alas, physics lessons aren\'t enough to ward one away from daredevil stunts; Aava has bungee jumping on her bucket list.',
        20: 'A man of classic and contemporary taste, Peter\'s all-time favourite music consists of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen and \"Night Burn\" by Ben Segev. His wide range of interests, from \"Lord of the Rings\" and roller skating to coding all boils down to dreams of being a software developer. He\'s certainly getting his training in - you can thank Peter for the timetable banner and authentication page updates. Being a Toronto Argonauts fan, one may find him throwing and kicking footballs during wellness breaks. In the meanwhile, he\'ll be relishing his dumplings and praying to pass Grade 12 Chemistry.',
        21: 'Aaron is chivalrous, knowing and respecting his values, interests, and disinterests. He fittingly describes himself as outgoing - he likes being around other people and pursuing his passions so much so that on his bucket list is travelling the world. Currently, Aaron has taken on the excellent development opportunity that encompasses building Project Metropolis\' mobile app. He loves programming (and school!) so much that his favourite subjects are ICS and TEJ, and he would even take ICS2 again, partial credits to Mr. Wong. A man who would wish for \"more time\" if he could, Aaron (unironically) lives by the words \"seek discomfort\" and \"work smart, not hard.\" You can find him playing Tetris, enjoying noodles and dumplings, listening to radio and Chinese pop, all while dreaming of being CEO of a company he founded and having a dog.',
        25: 'Although Daniel first joined the staff team as a learning experience, he has become someone reliable and integral to the development of Metropolis. Web development aside, he is not afraid to meet new people and help others, though he innately wishes for better social skills (and unlimited white tuna sushi, but that\'s beside the point). You can find Daniel on the Valorant grind with his friends or binging three anime seasons in one sitting.',
        32: 'With wishes of becoming a video game director, Justin joined the team with the intentions of helping out and practicing his programming. Justin is the main developer behind the club pages, but he regularly assists with all parts of web development, spreading the twin gospels of Pokemon and anime along the way.',
        33: 'Just like her work, Diana\'s taste is authentic; for her, life just wouldn\'t be the same without peanut sauce and noodles. Neither can she go without highly recommending Mini Motorways to anyone with an assignment due tomorrow.',
        35: 'Avery is the personification of \"free.\" Adventurous and spontaneous, their hobbies - drawing, baking, biking, and walking around aimlessly - render them a spirit you can look to for fun times. If you need a motivating study buddy Avery can be found in SAP and potentially Geography. If you would rather chill, Avery\'s a fan of Tyler the Creator, Tame Impala, and Kanye West, and a pro at Tetris. However, despite everything Avery may seem (for one, eager to move to NYC), their biggest trait is their profound mindfulness. As they express their love of WLMAC\'s halls\' congestion during transition times, Avery notes, \"Life moves pretty fast, if you don\'t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\"',
        56: 'Shane is the solicitous living being striving so open-mindedly that the universe loves him. It\'s why he would retake Geography if he could and why we know that as a YouTube content creator, reaching 100k subs would only take a matter of time. It\'s also why we\'re glad that Shane wasn\'t too distracted by hockey, swimming, badminton, cooking, sushi, 2010\'s music hits, or Big Bang Theory to see Project Metropolis as the single best opportunity to dive into software development. While Shane works hard at making the app more appealing for us, let\'s keep WLMAC a \"great environment\" - \"everyone works hard and helps each other.\"- for him.',
        66: 'On the surface, Jeremy appears to be a computer science geek. On top of dreaming of a career in the field and his experience fixing bugs on the Project Metropolis app, Jeremy would retake ICS for the excuse to make a game. Nonetheless, the man is layered and down-to-earth, although his recent addiction to Valorant and stanning of Karasuno (Haikyuu!) as his number 1 sports team may suggest otherwise. As a guitarist, Jeremy intends to release music on Spotify and ultimately attain the musical genius of WLMAC\'s very own Mr. Segev. Until then, he\'ll be enjoying the library, as well as perhaps Polyphia, Oshi No Ko, One Piece, or even snuck-in Jollibee\'s chicken, but surely most likely NodeJS.', 
        78: 'Although she may appear introverted, Annie\'s spiciness, like her favourite Korean ramen, lies even beyond her owning a dog and three cats. With plans to bungee jump and learn to whistle, she who was born on All Hallows\' Eve is a precious fusion of fun and practicality. If she could, she would wish that one minute\'s sleep could feel like ten hours\' worth. Although sports can be gruelling, she loves being a member of the Badminton team and would retake gym to get buff. The best part about Annie though is not her love of Webtoons. It\'s that she sees that Project Metropolis, with its graphics, merchandise, and employment of Chelsea and Zoe, is the best.',
        103: 'With her soulful heart, Celine makes a lasting impact wherever she sets foot; literally, as co-Captain of the Mac Dance Team. Her favourite movies are empowering rom-com hits from the 90s/200s, including Mean Girls and Legally Blonde, and her music taste extends from Ariana Grande to Blackpink. For Celine, Project Metropolis is an opportunity, not only to work with fellow (math) savants but to ensure WLMAC\'s ears are open to good music. For now, she would highly recommend listening to Eighteen by Key. To reinforce her wish for everyone to look back on life with no regrets, here are the song lyrics Celine lives by, "My mama said I\'m living today for tomorrow, my daddy said it won\'t be easy but that\'s life, you only live once."',
        139: 'We must thank Jeffery for giving us an opportunity to use the word \"polymath.\" A glance at his resume would make a valedictorian, teen entrepreneur, *and* athlete of the year rub their foreheads. Not only is he an appreciator of good food, like sushi, ribs, and pizza, Jeffery loves good teachers who go the extra mile, which are most WLMAC teachers. With his drive to learn and excel, Jeffery plays badminton, soccer, and frisbee, and reserves time for Netflix and reading (action and political thrillers) too. His bucket list items, from watching a Raptors game to touching a shark, only make it more exciting to imagine how Jeffery will fuse his passions when he one day runs a company that makes a positive impact.', 
        145: 'As someone who doesn’t take music-making lightly, Sion chooses to live life his way. Next to his bucket list item of releasing a music album is learning JS, and besides composing and playing piano, he likes watching YouTube and K-dramas. You can rely on Sion to produce the best tracks for Project Metropolis promo videos and doodle games, as well as point out the best Gukbap and soccer teams. At a time when maximalism is creeping, Sion values minimalistic clothing. In a place with intense competition, Sion enjoys WLMAC\'s comfy vibes. Amidst peers\' addictions to League, Genshin, and Valorant, he refuses to game. But if there’s one thing Sion might desire from others, it\'s an increase in his YouTube subscriber count. ',
        156: 'To describe Luka in a nutshell, his application to Project Metropolis instantly garnered him a seat in Frontend, Backend, *and* App. Like some others, Luka would be content with an IT job that paid just enough, and like many, he highly disapproves of TTC\'s Line 4 lack of extension. However, Luka\'s love of taking apart old electronics, fixing broken appliances, and landscape photography, set him apart. To join him in planning for your dreams of riding a train across Europe, being an extra in a movie, watching a rocket launch, and driving a Ford model, try the \"god-tier\" combo of apple slices and peanut butter. Luka\'s godliness, though, is most reinforced by his purity; he considers himself lucky and promises, \"It\'s ok to be average.\"',
        157: 'If you were to travel around the world in a renovated schoolie, collect all the most authentic souvenirs, and then mix and stir following precise instructions, you might be lucky enough to conjure a Rachel Ezzel Strouble. Beginning with the tiny holes above her ears, Rachel\'s talents and passions, from media arts to music, are limited not even by the sky. A fan of indie rock and Japanese city pop, guitar and choir, Glee and Spider Man for the PS4, pasta and soup, even lactose intolerance can\'t stop Rachel from enjoying peanut-butter-chocolate ice cream. Unless you can distract her with her first word \"hockey\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs.', 
        165: 'Imagine you are the Team admissions officer for Metropolis. An unassuming kid with ambiguous speech and an adorable twinkle in the eyes applies, announcing his devotion to “ddos-ing the server.” He also claims he has the persistence and purity to care enough about school to retake every course he didn’t get 100 on and improve his teachers’ and classmates’ standard of living in. A background check reveals that the guy is also a fan of melon soda, Nightmelon, HCI research, and 5 centimetres a second. A quantitative forecast predicts he will attempt to redesign every code section into gibberish languages even a project manager will cry over. Would you accept Ken Shibata? We’re sure glad we did.',
        183: 'Apart from gaslighting himself into thinking he\'s being useful by watching movies, playing TFT, blasting alt. rock music, or playing basketball with his totally existent friends, Zach is an allegedly avid thrifter, aspiring doctor, and prescribed iced-capp addict. His bucket list spans from bungee jumping to traveling around the world. A hilarious personality and an energetic mind, Zach only ever tries to bring the best to each piece of content released here at Metropolis. Whether he merits cancellation or not, he graciously leaves to you.',
        220: 'While Nirvan isn’t out on the soccer field or spiking volleyballs with his team, he is a down to earth, funny guy with an elated dedication to his friends and future shoe collection. Apart from joining the Metropolis team to further enhance his programming skills, he is busy reading his favourite science-fiction books and staying active year-round. Seeing that his hidden talent is his ability to do 92 Russian Twists in under 1 minute, his possibilities are boundless, as he works towards his goals daily. A deeply spirited Mackenzie student, Nirvan values WLMAC\'s amazing aura, \"Mackenzie has the best vibe ever, I love the atmosphere and the general environment.\" An amiable, convivial, and bright minded guy, Nirvan will bring ideas from conception to completion here at Metropolis!',
        222: 'If you think you joke too much about the time you spend playing video games, Patrick practices piano for up to 9 hours a day. And he’s not kidding. He also loves studying, and if you see a colossal pile of work, the self-prescribed nerd might be buried inside. That being said, Patrick, like his music taste, is more likely to be all over the place. One day, he will go from malding over DMOJ problems to working with AI (totally not trying to take over the world). On another, the C and K drama crusader and noodle (special shoutout to ramen) lover will be off to Japan. Ultimately, Patrick foremost loves his friends (including Mr. Wong) who keep him sane and safe; \"Times may get hard, but just know that it will all work out in the end.\"',
        235: 'Jacob is love. Jacob is life. Jacob is all-encompassing, all-knowing, an omnipotent god among mortals. What prevents him from truly transcending is one thing: a history of crippling League of Legends addictions. So yeah, he\'s one of us.',
        267: 'Just as her artistic touch is poignant, Alicia knows how to paint between the lines of on-point and venturesome; She has the drive and confidence to pursue her passions and yearnings given that they are genuinely her heart\'s desires. As of now, her affections lie with the book that enkindled 35 minutes straight of tears, \"The Book Thief,\" and pho. In the future, Alicia intends to travel the world, alone or with company, and broaden her horizons of diverse cultures, foods, and landscapes.',
        297: 'Considering his breadth of initiatives and values, Vlad is at once human and superhuman. He applied his knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS and React Native to a broad range of tasks involving the styling of the app\'s window screens as well as polishing styles and functionalities pertaining to the website\'s map and calendar. Often you will find Vlad on a bike ride, at the gym, or in his room developing a website for his international students.',
        347: 'The \"co\" in Connie stands for \"colour palette\" - perfect for a fine someone who knows where and if her tastes lie, and based on that, makes the decisions that shape her authenticity. According to she who describes herself as \"incredibly passive,\" Connie applied to Project Metropolis half-expecting to get rejected. However, her passion, including her fondness of horror, is exactly what our team values. Her spicy fancies, from dying her hair pastel pink to eating instant noodles so hot she can\'t taste anything else, are what make Connie cool. Fact: her art is so good the artist would rather the fashion of the clothes she draws over the world\'s mode manias.',
        360: 'Joshua excels at everything to the point that it\'s hard to tell if his what-would-be-typically unrealistic intentions are truly unfeasible. His bucket list items go from skydiving and touring Japan to developing superpowers. However, the devoted Concert Band member chose to join Project Metropolis and make doodles instead of competitive coding or, dare we say, playing Battle Cats, as well as stan his all-time favourite artist Sion Gang. Therefore, he must have good taste, so his dreams must have a good chance. The next time you catch Joshua relishing his lemon water, feel free to casually inquire about his Steinway & Sons piano.',
        411: 'The G in Glen stands for \"genuinely-good.\" Indeed, Glen is undeniably right when it comes to the delicacy of mapo tofu, the beauty of video game background music, and the intrigue of historical fiction (when not replaced by the horror of procrastination). For someone who has never experienced Canada\'s Wonderland, Glen finds malding over math and coding problems thrilling, and yearns for a software development job someday not too far away. By then, a Candidate Master DMOJ rating and trip to Japan will have been checked off his bucket list, but in the meanwhile, Glen will be vibing to J-pop and being an orz stack and web developer for Metropolis.',
        475: 'A video game and keyboard hobbyist, the things that make James James are also what make him a slick game developer for Mac Lyons\' Den. His favourite game is \"Control\" and he immerses himself wholeheartedly in the realm of alternative/modern rock like Twenty One Pilots, Half-Alive, and Weathers. He interestingly and genuinely considers ICS his favourite subject. Most fascinating, however, James proclaims a passionate food predilection for all vegetables, raw or cooked.',
        265: 'If one is in search of a teenager who manifests the spirit of a fresh, ambitious adolescent all with wholesomeness, they need not look further than Jimmy. An admirable conqueror of math, chess, competitive programming, and software development, Jimmy is also a badminton enthusiast. He takes his athletic abilities on screen, surfing Nintendo Wii and Mario Kart with a particular drive. On a final note, Jimmy, whose opinions are validated  by his loving of sushi, lives by the words, \"Try your best and forget the rest.\"',
        18: 'To put it simply, Zoe knows what she\'s doing. Already a master of balancing when to listen to others and when to follow her own path, Zoe\'s joining Project Metropolis was a decision our dear graphic designer made because \"Chelc said join and i listened because it\'s Chelc :D\" A true Canadian, Zoe curls too, and a true artist with soul, she is also the only oboeist at WLMAC. Zoe intends to continue living her life listening (to Chelc), doing her best, and designing graphics.',
        37: 'Just like her valued (and preferably spicy) noodles, Hazel is brimming with warmth, solace, and a dash of ardor. She is as relatable as a frontend developer can get, with her acknowledgement of procrastination and zeal for grinding Monkeytype. She is also as cool as anyone can get, being a spirited chess player and hockey fan. No true Canadian, nor Lyon for that matter, will ever feel lonely at a hockey game with Hazel who supports the Leafs (and especially enjoys watching them throw leads!) with all her heart.',
        61: 'Although the words he lives by are as unassuming as \"You fail, you forget,\" Caleb\'s level of commitment is impressive. After 262 hours of Celeste, he nears the game\'s 100% completion. With a passion for helping others and plans to learn x86 Assembly, C++, and HTML, Caleb\'s ultimate goal is to create games for friends. And while he enjoys binging YouTube, Lena Raine and YOASOBI will always come first. If you would rather have some ramen and play a little ukulele, Caleb is here for you too.',
        62: 'Derek Ma has such a bland personality he knows it. While others describe him as intimidating, Derek uses his suspiciously unsourced British-ism to describe himself as \"conscientious\"  and embrace his appreciation for good manners. Jokes aside, Derek\'s a good person. Like anyone with taste, his favourite food is lasagna. Like any true WLMAC patriot, his favourite part about our school is the geese. And like any typical tryhard, Derek would retake ICS if he could and dreams of becoming an investment banker. On his bucket list constructed from his stonks, cinematography, and computer hardware interests is building a computer, whaling on at least one character in Genshin Impact, and making it to retirement. Don\'t tell him you read it here, but old age seems to be a fear since Derek wishes he could advance healthcare to the point of curing aging. However, we\'ll never know too much about the man whose cool fact is that he likes starting fires... in a fireplace.',
        57: 'A baker, gardener, painter, birder, and dancer with five years of rhythmic gymnastics background, Julianne is raging with talent and passion of a caliber one would only believe if they saw it with their own eyes. Bright-eyed herself, Julianne describes herself as \"a person who really enjoys the little things in life.\" Diligent as she is, Julianne’s bucket list actually stands a chance at being realized because she\'s already on it: getting back to rock climbing and learning ASL. If the girl is starting to look too intimidating, she offers her comfort song: Castle Town by Toby Fox. As for why she\'s here, the Laufey lover intends to give WLMAC some fun content to enjoy and, bless her soul, help the team get some sleep.',
        98: 'Peter\'s charm lies in how he champions his tastes in a cleverly inviting, kindly open-minded way like no one else can. Despite his devotion to Genshin Impact, Tetris, and A Certain Magical Index and claims of wishing to be able to do nothing for a living (except *maybe* teaching kids), Peter is an enthusiast for challenges and Earth\'s wonders. From cubing to badminton, Asian pop to Physics, his love for sushi to his promise to code 3D graphics, Peter\'s life is far from boring. What completes it is his persistent regard for all humans - credits to him for ensuring Project Metropolis Lead Waba (2022) always finished his work for the night to play League.', 
        338: 'Beaming with energy and curiosity, Alisa does more than live for the universe\'s wonders. She is a living wonder, from her ability to wiggle her ears to her love for sashimi and \"Breaking Bad.\" Her arrival in Project Metropolis - \"*thee* place for innovation\" - promises website design like never before and the development of a hamster lover who aspires to create the ultimate hamster enclosure. If you express your love for learning new things, especially photography and PC building, Alisa might sneak you a peek at her crystal collection and, if you\'re lucky, take you with her when she travels the world.',
        414: 'Edna is the epitome of elevation, from her motto \"hustle\" to her showstopping afro. With a taste for Jollof rice, strawberry milk, and contemporary R&B, she has what teachers look for in kids - love for the challenge in Math, the creativity of English, and the wonders of Science - as well as what kids hope for from teachers - someone you can look up to (literally!). If the future civil/architectural engineer and current equity rep isn\'t contributing to Mac Lyons\' Den, there\'s no shortage of places you might find her, from the track, soccer field, or volleyball court to classic or mystery literature to the glory of WLMAC\'s "hallway covered with blue ears."', 
        659: 'Savoury like pasta and sweet like chocolate, Lea\'s bucket list is as simple yet powerful as three words: \"Make an impact.\" Indeed, from bullet journaling to dreaming of becoming an architectural engineer, \"impact\" defines Lea\'s vision for herself and the world (placing aside her distaste for soccer). Her enthusiasm shines beyond her love of science and extends into fashion, mystery novels, Gilmore Girls, Nintendo, and (clearly) Metropolis. As a friend who is practical and creative, dramatic and cultivated, her first message to you from our platform is, \"if you can do something in under a minute, do it now.\"',
        677: 'Behind her musing eyes, Warisha brims with stories to tell and longings to quell. Her love for sweet things - sliced peaches, donuts, cheesecake - reflects her character that cannot be made bitter by slipping in mud during a soccer game, nor by Mac\'s bustling hallways, which the aspiring aerospace engineer adores for their sense of community. The girl saw Avatar (2009) five times, is a big Weeknd fan and plans to do everything from riding a hot air balloon to seeing a Shakespeare play and the ice sculptures of Norway. Yet, she remains sane enough to maintain a collection of storybook quotes and remind you, \"Don\'t let failure get to your heart and success get to your head.\"',
        729: 'Often, there is something you need, but don\'t know it; Siya is the personification of that feeling. With her, you will never miss out on what matters, not on Bedwars, and not on wise words; \"Please learn to cherish yourself first. Otherwise you cannot cherish others.\" For this writer and drawer, romance and dog lover, and eager adventurer (across Canada, to India, Denmark, Japan, and beyond!), her passion on reproductive health is her \"raison d’etre\" a gynecologist, and her love for her dog Zane has built a hope to foster shelter more animals in the future. Siya shines her voice and vision everywhere and especially here on Mac Lyons’ Den.', 
        746: 'With personality and persistence that radiates around him, Jason can be defined as heavily motivated, \"a knowledge enthusiast\", [and] annoying. After getting into coding at age 11, Jason now not only believes that his code should have a purpose - as an aspiring software developer, it is his purpose. That being said, you don\'t have to be an avid programmer to befriend Jason. Whether it\'s through computers, HIMYM, Star Wars, cooking, music, Ultimate Frisbee, or dogs, Jason\'s a living and breathing wish for bliss. Oh and here\'s the obligatory \"I use arch btw\".', 
        799: 'As a human and a dreamer, Colin personifies much of Project Metropolis\' core values and vision. That is why he saw in us, more than Minecraft, the outlet he had long been looking for through which to share his love of programming to the world.
